# UW-Book-Store---Database-Management-System

Business Problem/Objective:
The bookstore wants to gather data so that it can use it to draw insights to aid business decisions. The bookstore wants to improve its financial decisions, understand the customer spending behavior, analyze the different product's performance and take actions for revenue growth and improve customer acquisition.
For this project, we have created the Entity Relationship Diagram for the UW BookStore, whose business is to sell books and merchandise in the state. We have created a schema that stores information about daily transactions of the Bookstore at the various locations.
